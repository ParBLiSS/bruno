    /**
     * @class bliss::io::SequencesIterator
     * @brief Iterator for parsing and traversing a block of data to access individual sequence records (of some file format)
     * @details The iterator is initialized with start and end iterators pointing to a block of character data.
     *
     *    The source data should be of primitive type such as unsigned char.  The input iterators should be aligned
     *    to record boundaries.
     *
     *    The iterator uses a Parser Functoid to walk through the data one sequence record (e.g. read) at a time.  Different Parser
     *    types may be used, e.g. FASTA, FASTQ, to parse different file formats.
     *
     *    The iterator has the following characteristics.
     *      transforming  (changes data type)
     *      delimiting    (trivial search for the end of the "record" / beginning of next record.)
     *      finite        (needs to know base iterator's end.)
     *
     *    Design considerations:
     *      1. Repeated calls to operator*() returns the same output, WITHOUT reparsing the underlying data
     *      2. Repeated calls to operator++() moves the current pointer forward each time
     *      3. Comparison of 2 SequencesIterators compares the underlying input iterators at the start positions of the current record
     *      4. Iterator states:  before first use, during use, after reaching the end.
     *          before:  operator* points to the first output, no need to call ++ first.  so this is same case as "during".
     *          during:  operator* gets the most current output that's a result of calling ++, ++ moves pointer forward
     *          after:   operator* returns empty result, ++ is same as no-op.
     *     Based on these, we need to
     *      1. cache the output
     *      2. keep a current iterator  (for comparison between SequencesIterators)
     *      3. keep a next iterator     (for parsing)
     *      4. have constructor parse the first entry, so that dereference functions properly
     *      5. check for end condition  (next == end) and return if at end.
     *
     *      The Parser functoid then only has 1 simple task:  to increment, as it does not need to store locally.
     *
     * @note this iterator is not a random access or bidirectional iterator, as traversing in reverse is not implemented.
     *
     * @tparam Iterator	  Base iterator type to be parsed into sequences
     * @tparam Parser     Functoid type to parse data pointed by Iterator into sequence objects..
     * @tparam SequenceType  Sequence Type.  replaceable as long as it supports Quality if Parser requires it.
