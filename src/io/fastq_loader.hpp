     * @details   The purpose of this class is to abstract the increment operations in
     *    an iterator that transforms a block of data into a collection of FASTQ records. Using this class allows us to reuse
     *    an sequence parsing iterator, but potentially for different sequence record formats.
     *
     *    This class assumes that the iterator at start is pointing to the beginning of a FASTQ record already.
     *    Increment is done by walking through the data and recording the positions of the start and end of each
     *    of the 4 lines in a FASTQ record.  Because we are always searching to the end of a record (by reading 4 lines always),
     *    successive calls to increment always are aligned correctly with record boundaries
     *
     * @note  all sequences now have the quality score iterators.
     * @note  NOT THREAD SAFE.
     *
     * @tparam Iterator   The underlying iterator to be traversed to generate a Sequence

         *     search for first occurrence of @ from an arbitrary offset in data, thus getting the position of the beginning of a FASTQ sequence record within the block.
         *
         *        A FASTQ sequence record has the following general structure (expressed as regular expression.  not
         *          rigorously expressed)
         *
         *          [@][^\n]*\n[ATCGN]+\n[+].*\n[\^n]*\n
         *
         *        line 1 has "@" followed by the name of the sequence, which can contain any ascii character except newline
         *        line 2 is the biological sequence, with a constrained alphabet
         *        line 3 has "+" followed by either newline or by some other string, potentially the name of the sequence
         *        line 4 has the quality scores, encoded as ascii
         *
         *        because line 4 may start with "@" or "+", there can be ambiguity in identifying a line as the true start of a record.
         *        further, because lines 1, 3, and 4 may contain "@" and "+", there can be ambiguity when a L1 or L2 partitioning
         *          produces a DataBlock with first character in the middle of lines 1, 3, or 4.  This method implements a simple
         *          algorithm to disambiguate these cases by scanning multiple lines, to find the true start of a FASTQ record.
         *
         *        Specifically, we are looking for the pairing of a @ line and a + line separated by 1 line
         *          e.g. .*\n[@][^\n]*\n[ATCGN]+\n[+].*\n.*
         *
         *        this combination can occur at 2 places only: at beginning of read/sequence, or if read name contains @ and the L1 or L2 DataBlock happens to start there.
         *
         *        we can also look for + followed by @ in 2 lines.
         *          e.g. [ATCGN]*\n[+][^\n]*\n[^\n]+\n[@].*\n.*
         *
         *        this combination can also occur at 2 places only.
         *
         *    using just 1 of these patterns would require us to search through up to 7 lines.
         *      pattern 1 works better if partition starts on lines 3 or 4, and pattern 2 works better if partition starts on 1 or 2.
         *    using both patterns, we can just look at 4 lines.
         *
         *
         * Decoding logic:
         * standard pattern is @x*
         *                     l*
         *                     +x*
         *                     q*
         *                     @x*
         *                     l*
         *                     +x*
         *                     q*
         *                     ....
         *                  x could be @, +, or other char except "\n".
         *                  l is alphabet, so no @, +, or "\n"
         *                  q could be @, +, or other char within some ascii range., no "\n"
         *
         *
         *  Algorithm:
         *          ignore all characters before the first "\n" in the DataBlock
         *          Read 4 lines starting from the first "\n" found and save the first characters.
         *            If the DataBlock is the first one in the parent DataBlock/Range,
         *            then treat the block as if it's prefixed with a "\n"
         *              e.g. first L1Block in the File's range,
         *              e.g. first L2Block in the parent L1Block (L1Block are record-aligned by the same process)
         *          inspect the first char, and look for either @..+ or +..@.
         *
         * @note    the range should be large enough so that we would not run into trouble with partition search not finding a starting position.

    /**
     * @class FASTQLoader
     * @brief FileLoader subclass specialized for the FASTQ file format, uses CRTP to enforce interface consistency.
     * @details   FASTQLoader understands the FASTQ file format, and enforces that the
     *            L1 and L2 partition boundaries occur at FASTQ sequence record boundaries.
     *
     *            FASTQ files allow storage of per-base quality score and is typically used
     *              to store a collection of short sequences.
     *            Long sequences (such as complete genome) can be found in FASTQ formatted files
     *              these CAN be read using standard FileLoader, provided an appropriate overlap
     *              is specified (e.g. for kmer reading, overlap should be k-1).
     *
     *          for reads, expected lengths are maybe up to 1K in length, and files contain >> 1 seq
     *
     *          Majority of the interface is inherited from FileLoader.
     *          This class modifies the behaviors of GetNextL1Block and getNextL2Block,
     *            as described in FileLoader's "Advanced Usage".  Specifically, the range is modified
     *            for each block by calling "find_first_record" to align the start and end to FASTQ sequence
     *            record boundaries.
     *
     * @note    Processes 1 file at a time.  For paired end reads, a separate subclass is appropriate.
     *          Sequences are identified by the following set of attributes:
     *
     *             file id.          (via filename to id map)
     *             read id in file   (e.g. using the offset at whcih read occurs in the file as id)
     *             position in read  (useful for kmer)
     *
     *          using the offset as id allows us to avoid d assignment via prefix sum.
     *
     * @tparam  T                 type of each element read from file
     * @tparam  L1Buffering       bool indicating if L1 partition blocks should be buffered.  default to false
     * @tparam  L2Buffering       bool indicating if L2 partition blocks should be buffered.  default to true (to avoid contention between threads)
     * @tparam  L1PartitionerT    Type of the Level 1 Partitioner to generate the range of the file to load from disk
     * @tparam  L2PartitionerT    L2 partitioner, default to DemandDrivenPartitioner
