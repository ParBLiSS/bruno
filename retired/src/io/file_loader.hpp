  /**
   * @brief  Partitions input data into sequences, e.g. blocks or reads.
   * @details  Iterator template parameter refers to the iterator type that is currently being traversed.
   * 		 this applies to the sequence object, and the following methods:
   * 		 get_next_record, and find_first_record.
   * 		 
   * 		 init method can potentially use a different iterator type. this is useful when
   * 		   state information is extracted from perhaps a containing block (e.g. L1Block),
   * 		   then used with a sub block (e.g. L2Block).  
   * 		 	
   * @note   there are 2 (non-interchangeable) scenarios when we may need to change the iterator type.
   *    1. L1 at process level, L2 at thread level.  SeqParser state is calculated at L1.
   *    2. L1 at rank 0 of a sub communicator (processes), L2 is broadcast from rank0 of the rest of processes.  SeqParser state is calculated at L1.
   *
   *    to handle the first case: approaches are
   *    1a. to allow a parser to operate on different iterator types when invoking find_first_record, increment.
   *          additional template parameter for these functions.  SequenceType will need to change.
   *          API in SequenceIterator, BaseFileParser, FASTQParser, FASTAParser all need to change
   *    1b. convert the seq parser from L1 to L2, but copy the state of L1.
   *          can be shared between threads.  additional api for convert only
   *
   *    to handle the second case.
   *    2a. convert the seq parser from L1 to L2, communicate (and copy) the state of L1.
   *          additional api for convert and broadcast. minimal api change. requires L1 to be block (or cyclic with synchronization).
   *    2b. create seq parser for L2, and initialize using all processes.
   *          no api change, but works only when L1 and L2 are block partitioned (or cyclic with synchronization).
   *          potentially less communication, and Parser does not need to have a broadcast semantic.
   *
   *    1a is not general, potentially complicated, and a source of potential errors.
   *    1b and 2a share common apis.
   *    2b requires application to specifically call init at L2.  Also, already initialized L1 during data load.
   *
   *    choose 2b and 1b.  Sequence Iterator does not call init_for_iterator, mostly for flexibility and compatibility with case 1.
   *         
   * @tparam Iterator   The underlying iterator to be traversed to generate a Sequence

    /**
     * @class FileLoader
     * @brief Opens a file (or a portion of it) via memmap, and optionally copies(portion of) data into memory.
     * @details FileLoader is similar to an iterator but does not use the same API.  It has a set of getNext__ functions
     *            for traversing the file in BLOCKS.
     *
     *            The decision not to follow iterator API is due to thread support:  the thread id would need to be
     *            passed in to the iterator operators, thus would already create a departure from the iterator API.
     *            Also, the increment and dereference operations need to be bundled together to support atomicity, which
     *            also is different than the standard iterator approach.
     *
     *            FileLoader "getNext__" functions returns a DataBlock.  DataBlock has begin and end iterators for traversing
     *              the individual data elements, and can provide buffering.
     *
     *        2-Level Partitioning:
     *          FileLoader uses a 2 level partitioning, in order to support multiprocess (mpi)
     *          and multithreaded (openmp) concurrent file access.
     *
     *          The first level partitioning generates "L1 BLOCKs".
     *          L1Block of a file is loaded from disk/network with its own mmap call.
     *          This makes L1Blocks suited for distinct, independent FileLoader processes, e.g. MPI processes
     *
     *          The second level partitioning generates "L2 BLOCKSs".
     *          L2Blocks represent a further partitioning of a parent L1Block, and therefore does not have its own mmap call.
     *          L2Blocks are suited for distinct but cooperative computing processes, e.g. openmp threads.
     *
     *          Both L1 and L2 Blocks are specified using bliss::partition::Range, and represented by bliss::io::DataBlocks.
     *          DataBlocks optionally provides buffering at the L1 and/or L2 Block level.  See bliss::io::DataBlock for
     *          additional details.
     *
     *          Having a 2 level partitioning provides flexibility and encourages sequential file access (for L2Blocks).
     *          It is not necessary that L2Block be used, however, as L1 Blocks can be used directly for data traversal.
     *
     *        MemMap
     *          Memmap maps a file to a memory address range, and allows direct, random access to the
     *          file.  it utilizes the same mechanism as virtual memory paging, so it's efficient.
     *          Performance of mmap is good generally compared to traditional file open-read-close-process
     *          NOTE: reading past the mmapped length can cause SEGV
     *
     *  Simple Usage:
     *    1. instantiate file_loader - // default partitioning is based on MPI communicator
     *                                 // but user can also specify the number of partitions and partition id directly
     *    2. getNextL1Block()          // get the next L1 DataBlock for the current partition id (e.g. rank)
     *
     *    3. [get the iterators (begin(),end()) and do some work.  (L1 Block traversal)]
     *      or
     *      loop
     *        getNextL2Block(),
     *        [then get the iterators (begin(),end()) and do some work.  (L2 Block traversal)]
     *
     *    4. destroy file_loader          // close the file.
     *
     *
     *  Any modification to the L1 and L2 partitioning, specifically modifying the associated Range object, or additional partitioning,
     *          such as partitioning by record, should be done by subclasses of FileLoader.  This falls under the Advanced Usage show below.
     *
     *  Advanced Usage:  This should be relevant to subclasses only, as most of these methods are protected.
     *    1. instantiate file_loader - // default partitioning is based on number of MPI processes.
     *                                // but user can also specify the number of partitions.
     *    2. getNextL1BlockRange()       // allows iteration over partition ids, mapping of process to partition other than 1 to 1.
     *    ...                         // modify range
     *    3. getL1DataForRange(range)    // actually open the file and memmap
     *
     *
     *    4. [get the iterators (begin(),end()) and do some work.  (L1 Block traversal)]
     *      or
     *      loop
     *        getNextL2BlockRange(),
     *        ...                      // modify range
     *        getL2DataForRange(range) // get the data. and optionally buffering
     *        [then get the iterators (begin(),end()) and do some work.  (L2 Block traversal)]
     *
     *    5. unload                       // mem unmap
     *    6. destroy file_loader          // close the file.
     *
     * Alternatively, modify the range in BaseFileParser.  See fastq_loader.hpp for example.
     *
     * @note:   For real data,  No Buffering is better for large files and limited memory, while
     *              buffering is better for smaller files and/or large amount of memory.
     *          FileLoader is the base class in a CRTP static polymorphism pattern.
     *
     *          Memmap require page aligned addresses.  Internally, this class has pointers to the
     *          start of the range of interest, not to the page aligned starting position.
     *          DataBlocks therefore has at the "begin" iterator the first element OF INTEREST in the mmapped range,
     *            not the first element mapped.
     *
     * @tparam  T                 type of each element read from file
     * @tparam  Overlap           Size of overlap between L1 or L2 blocks. in units of T.  this affects mmap.
     * @tparam  Parser            Sequence Parser for generating the the sequence objects.  NOTE: template template parameter, template being an Iterator with value type T.
     * @tparam  L1Buffering       bool indicating if L1 partition blocks should be buffered.  default to false
     * @tparam  L2Buffering       bool indicating if L2 partition blocks should be buffered.  default to true (to avoid contention between threads)
